        "To begin with, let's start a new Spark™ session. Since this notebook is a tutorial merely to illustrate what Hyperspace can offer, we will make a configuration change that allow us to highlight what Hyperspace is doing on small datasets. By default, Spark™ uses *broadcast join* to optimize join queries when the data size for one side of join is small (which is the case for the sample data we use in this tutorial). Therefore, we disable broadcast joins so that later when we run join queries, Spark™ uses *sort-merge* join. This is mainly to show how Hyperspace indexes would be used at scale for accelerating join queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of running the cell below shows a reference to the successfully created Spark™ session and prints out '-1' as the value for the modified join config which indicates that broadcast join is successfully disabled."

        "Often times, if your underlying source data had some new files appended or existing files deleted, your index will get stale and Hyperspace decides not to use it. However, there are times where you just want to use the index without having to refresh it everytime. There could be multiple reasons for doing so:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. You do not want to continuosly refresh your index but instead want to do it periodically since you understand your workloads the best.  \n",
        "  2. You added/removed only a few files and do not want to wait for yet another refresh job to finish. \n",
        "\n",
        "To allow you to still use a stale index, Hyperspace introduces **Hybrid Scan**, a novel technique that allows users to utilize outdated or stale indexes (e.g., the underlying source data had some new files appended or existing files deleted), without refreshing indexes. \n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve this, when you set the appropriate configuration to enable Hybrid Scan, Hyperspace modifies the query plan to leverage the changes as following:\n",
        "- Appended files can be merged to index data by using **`Union` or `BucketUnion` (for join)**. Shuffling appended data can also be applied before merging, if needed.\n",
        "- Deleted files can be handled by injecting `Filter-NOT-IN` condition on **lineage column** of index data, so that the indexed rows from the deleted files can be excluded at query time. \n",

        "When you ready to update your indexes but do not want to rebuild your entire index, Hyperspace supports updating indexes in an incremental manner using `hs.refreshIndex(\"name\", \"incremental\")` API. This will allow eliminate the need for a full rebuild of index from scratch, utilizing previously created index files as well as updating indexes on only the newly added data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, please be sure to use the complementary `optimizeIndex` API (shown below) periodically to make sure you do not see performance regressions. We recommend calling `optimize` at least once for every 10 times you call `refreshIndex(..., \"incremental\")`, assuming the data you added/removed is < 10% of the original dataset. For instance, if your original dataset is 100 GB, and you've added/removed data in increments/decrements of 1 GB, you can call `refreshIndex` 10 times before calling `optimizeIndex`. Please note that this example is simply used for illustration and you have to adapt this for your workloads.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the example below, notice the addition of a `Sort` node in the query plan when indexes are used. This is because partial indexes are created on the appended data files, causing Spark to introduce a `Sort`. Please also note that `Shuffle` i.e. `Exchange` is still eliminated from the plan, giving you the appropriate acceleration."
